## Requirements

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `opencv`
- `jupyterlab`

## Usage
To run the pipeline simply launch and run the notebook in jupyter lab:

`jupyter lab`

## Directory structure
```
|-- demo.gif              -> Demo of the pipeline.
|-- lane_finding.ipynb    -> Notebook containing all code and results.
|-- lane_finding.pdf      -> Print out of the notebook containing all code and results.
|-- test_images           -> Directory containing the test images to test the pipeline.
|-- test_videos           -> Input videos to annotate.
|-- test_videos_output    -> Output annotated videos.
`-- writeup               -> Write up of the method, results and discussion.
```
