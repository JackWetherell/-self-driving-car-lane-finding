In this project, the goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video.

Relevent directories and files:
- examples: Directory containing some example data and code.
- test_images: Directory containing the test images to test the pipeline.
- lane_finding.ipynb: Notebook containing all code and results.
- lane_finding.pdf: Print out of the notebook containing all code and results
- test_vidoes: Input videos to annotate.
- test_vidoes_output: Output annotated videos.
- writeup.pdf: Write up of the method, results and discussion.
